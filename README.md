# odin-recipes
From The Odin Project - HTML basics assignment

Project on the "Foundations" path of The Odin Project, on the HTML section

The end result should be a simple webpage, with hyperlinks to (at least) 3 different recipes.
Recipes should be presented as an unordered list for ingredients and an ordered list for instructions.
Images on the webpages are optional, but good practice, and hopefully make the webpage look less atrocious.

After finishing this project, I should be able to demonstrate the following:
1. Basic understanding of HTML
2. Ability to create a new, simple, webpage from scratch
3. Basic knowledge of the workings of git and github
4. Basic knowledge and proof-of-use of terminal (command line) commands
