    <h1>Paksimadia (Greek-style olive oil rusks)</h1>
    <img src="../images/paksimadia.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Double baked for extra crispiness, these go great in Greek salad, or with feta cheese and olive paste, or even on their own (for indulgent savants).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>220g water</li>
        <li>8g dry yeast (1 sachet)</li>
        <li>10g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>100g olive oil (+extra for the bowl)</li>
        <li>400g all-purpose (plain) flour</li>
        <li>100g whole wheat flour</li>        
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixer's bowl add the water, yeast, sugar, and whisk them well.</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil, whole-wheat flour and plan flour, and beat the mixture with the hook attachment at low speed for 5-6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add salt 30 seconds before the end, and keep beating until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Grease a large bowl and put the dough in.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with cling film and set aside in room temperature, until the dough rises and doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Put the dough on your working surface and cut in half.</li>
        <li>Stretch out each dough piece with your hands and shape it into a roll. The thicker your roll, the bigger the rusks will come out.</li>
        <li>Line a baking pan with oven paper and place the dough pieces on it.</li>
        <li>Using a knife, score the top surface of the dough, creating vertical lines at equal distances.</li>
        <li>Allow the dough rolls to rise for another 30 mins.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 170 degrees Celsius (fan)</li>
        <li>Bake the rusks for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow the rusks to cool well.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven again to 170 degrees Celsius (fan)</li>
        <li>Cut the rusks at the scored lines and bake them for another 25-30 minutes until golden and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven. Serve in a bowl with spinach, cherry tomatoes, capers, olives, olive oil, salt, pepper, cream cheese and balsamic cream.</li>
