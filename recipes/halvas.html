    <h1>Halvas (semolina dessert)</h1>
    <img src="../images/Halvas.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A dessert that comes from the Middle-East, but well loved and well known to the Greek cuisine. The recipe is as simple as 1-2-3-4 (1 part olive oil, 2 parts semolina, 3 parts sugar, 4 parts water), but it is equally easy to fail. Small details will elevate this dessert to another level.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup semolina (coarse)</li>
        <li>1 cup semolina (thin)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups crystallized sugar</li>
        <li>4 cups of water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup black raisins</li>
        <li>1/2 cup roast almonds (whole)</li>
        <li>rind of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 tsp cinnamon powder</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the syrup: In a saucepan, place the water, sugar, lemon rind and cinnamon stick on low heat.</li>
        <li>Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved and bring to the boil.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and allow to cool down.</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil to a wide based pot and turn the heat to medium-high.</li>
        <li>When hot (not burned!) add both the thin and the coarse semolina.</li>
        <li>Roast the semolina on medium-high heat until it turns golden-brown and releases its aroma. Do not burn, as it will turn bitter.</li>
        <li>Towards the end, stir in the cinnamon powder, the raisins, and the almonds.</li>
        <li>Gradually and VERY CAREFULLY (it splashes and burns), add the prepared syrup to the pot and stir.</li>
        <li>Continue stirring on low heat, until the mixture takes a dough-like appearance and comes off the walls of the pot on its own.</li>
        <li>Remove the cinnamon stick and the lemon rind.</li>
        <li>While still hot, transfer to a cake pan (or similar container - be creative) and press with a wooden spoon to remove any pockets of air.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool for 30 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
